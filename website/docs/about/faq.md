## What are critical raw materials (CRMs)?​

Critical raw materials (CRM) are metals, non-metals (minerals) and other substances (e.g. Helium) that are considered essential for renewable energy transition, digital economy, and national security and whose supply may be at risk due to geological scarcity, geopolitical issues, trade policy or other factors. 
CRM classifications might vary between countries, different sections of governments, and different industries (eg. Figure 1. The US DoE Matrix). However, the criticality assignment is always defined by potential supply risk, economic importance (demand), and ESG impact of CRM substances.

## Why do CRMs require high levels of traceability?​

Due to their scarcity and concentration in select geographic regions, many countries rely on the import of CRMs, creating a high supply risk. Critical minerals receive increased pressure for traceability in accordance with international climate regulation, and digital technology has been identified as a valuable tool to support these initiatives.  

## What is UN/CEFACT’s Critical Raw Materials Traceability and Sustainability Project?​

Critical raw material (CRM) producers provide essential materials like lithium, cobalt, copper, and graphite to countries across the world. CRM supply chains are often long and complex, involving multiple organizations and crossing several international borders as materials move from raw material extraction to finished products.

Globally, sustainability data is held on various platforms using differing standards. CRM producers are increasingly being asked to meet a range of evolving domestic and international requirements to satisfy regulatory and consumer demand. There are many supply chain traceability solutions on the market, but most do not allow data to be shared between them. CRM producers need an efficient and trustworthy way to prove their sustainability performance along international supply chains.
The UN/CEFACT Critical Raw Materials Traceability and Sustainability Project (“the  project”) is connecting experts from across the world to research current international sustainability standards and reporting platforms. The project will use this research to identify ways to improve compatibility between current sustainability standards and digital tools and create a framework for international data exchange that increases trust and traceability.

With simple and secure methods to prove their sustainability performance, actors along CRM supply chains are better positioned to compete in global markets that prioritize sustainable goods, encouraging a wider adherence to responsible mining practices.

## What is the Project trying to achieve?​

The project seeks to make CRM supply chains more sustainable and resilient by improving transparency and traceability.

* Sustainable supply chains minimize environmental impacts and maximize human welfare.
* Resilient supply chains avoid risky dependencies and can withstand disruptions.
* The project aims to create standards for:
* Compatibility between digital tools and reporting platforms;
* Identifying areas of consensus within existing sustainability certifications.
* These standards will enable data to be exchanged internationally, making it easier to prove where and how critical raw materials are extracted and used.
