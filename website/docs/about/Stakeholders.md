This section of the UNTP-CRM project website outlines why interested parties would seek to implement UNTP-CRM and contribute to its development and maintenance. It provides an overview of the value of adoption for individual organizations and entire supply chains. For guidance on value proposition and/or business case development, see the [Resources and Templates section.](https://uncefact.github.io/project-crm/docs/resources/)

## Value for Participants

The value participants can realize is dependent on both the phase of implementation and the type of actor you represent in the value chain. These variances are outlined in the tables below. Additionally, there is overarching value for all actors who become UNTP-CRM implementers. This includes:
* contributing to the shaping of the standard
* marketing your products on a list of conformant implementations
* activating and/or advancing your community network (i.e., buyers, sellers, certifiers) across a commodity or geographic sector
* implementing a low volume pilot that can seamlessly scale to full volume production

## Value at Different Stages of Implementation

The table below outlines the value an implementer will realize upon completion of each of the three different stages of implementation. These outcomes are actor agnostic and grounded in our understanding of value obtained in other global supply chain pilots. Value for CRM-specific actors may vary as we learn more about your implementation process.

## Role-Based Value 

All value chain actors will have specific outcomes they hope to achieve through the implementation of the UNTP-CRM. While derived value may be the same or similar for some actors, there are also distinct benefits for each role. The value of engaging in this project is outlined in the table below, and will continue to be added to as more implementers report on their experience. 

The table below outlines the value of participation for UNTP-CRM implementers, including miners, smelters, processors, manufacturers, regulators, performance certifiers, and traceability software solution vendors.
