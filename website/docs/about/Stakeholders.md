## CRM Stakeholders

Persona map with pre/post UNTP-CRM experience goes here.

Role | Rationale
--|--
Mining operators | The mining operators are the start of the value chain and for the operators that are generating the origin claims and investing in ESG activities, it will be important that they can provably demonstrate their activities so that they can access markets and capital that value those investments in ESG outcomes. 
Refiners & manufacturers | The key challenges weâ€™ll be focusing on for refiners and manufacturers will be how they demonstrate the provenance claims and ESG features of the inputs to the products that they produce and how the credentials about those inputs are 'attached' to the goods that they are producing.
ESG standards & certifiers | The value of the standard and/or certifications are tied directly to the value the market places of having trustable proof that the goods or services meet the standard.  A verifiable certificate provides this proof.  The certification and accreditation community creates an important trust anchor.
Software vendors | Sharing digital credentials about the material origin and ESG of data of the CRM industry is going to be powered by the digital tools that members of the supply chain use.  This paper is intended to articulate how software vendors can extend their existing infrastructure in a low-cost and scalable manner to support the industry.
Government organizations | When governments subsidize critical minerals for strategic or national interest purposes, proof that the national interest has been met could be provided by leveraging a verifiable certificate that provides proof of the benefit.
Regulators | Regulators play a unique role in any value chain.  They can be a trust anchor that helps their regulated community outcompete in a global marketplace. However, regulators require traceability in order to be effective. This paper will highlight principles to enable regulators to require verifiable and enforceable standards, by providing a model to corroborate and authenticate claims effectively.
People | Impacts on people are generally the fundamental driver of regulatory standards. By having an avenue to weigh in on the validation process of claims, people impacted can have some leverage to ensure that regulations are followed in alignment with their original purpose.  By providing evidence-driven pathways for people to participate, it may be that conflicts of interest can be channelled productively into evidence gathering.
