UNTP-CRM focuses primarily on the publishing and linking of up- and midstream supply chain data. It intends to provide a high integrity upstream data feedstock to supply downstream regulatory compliance DPPs, industry-developed DPPs for batteries and automotives, and digital systems for customs agencies, who must undertake supply chain due diligence assessments of products entering their borders. The UNTP-CRM Project Team is actively working with related initiatives to achieve interoperability and mutual recognition. 

Although the supply chain structure for specific CRM commodities may vary, the following diagram depicts a general mineral or metal type CRM supply chain including process stages, operator, and output product. This also shows the relationship between UNTP-CRM and downstream DPP initiatives.
