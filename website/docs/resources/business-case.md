## Value Proposition for Early Implementers

Based on our interactions with potential early implementers, weâ€™ve observed a typical engagement pattern, in which an interested party within an organization reaches out to the project team regarding participation as an implementer, and requires additional information about 1) resources required and 2) value of participation. Armed with this information, they can advocate for participation to other relevant decision makers within their organization, such as their sustainability, IT and supply chain leads. With this in mind, we have developed a value proposition template to assist potential implementers to articulate the benefits of participation and resources required for their organization.  As you develop your value proposition, we suggest you map and activate your community, as the value of early implementation will increase when multiple parties can share verified data interoperably. 

## Business Case for Implementers

The decision to move through the phases of UNTP-CRM implementation will need a positive business case to justify the investment. The purpose of this page is to provide a framework for business case development that can be adapted to the stage of implementation and type of implementer. Early implementers can use the [UNTP cost-benefit models and business case templates](https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/docs/business-case/BusinessCaseTemplates) to assist with this process. They should provide feedback to the project team to refine these templates for CRM-specific use cases both at individual and community level.
