<Disclaimer />

An explanation of testing services can be found at the “Testing Services” section of the UNTP site: https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/docs/tools-and-support/TestService. The tools and guidance for their use can be accessed at: GitHub - uncefact/tests-untp: UNTP mock implementations and test cases.

Results from early implementations will enable the CRM project team to create CRM-specific testing services, as needed.
