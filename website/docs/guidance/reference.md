<Disclaimer />

Test implementations assist individual implementers and communities of implementers to test your conformance with UNTP-CRM, prior to broad adoption.  These tools allow early implementers to manually create trial digital credentials, and publish them so they can be accessed by other pilot implementers, such as trading partners, customs authorities, investors. You can find other planned implementers here, with whom you can test your test implementation. 

Description of tools for undertaking a test implementation can be found at the UNTP site here: https://uncefact.github.io/spec-untp/docs/tools-and-support/ReferenceImplementation. The tools and guidance for their use can be accessed at: GitHub - uncefact/tests-untp: UNTP mock implementations and test cases
