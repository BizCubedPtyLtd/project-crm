### Design Principles 

This document is guided by the following principles
1. Simple and implementable always wins over expansive & complex.
2. Open and free is a fundamental requirement.
3. Collaborative development encourages buy-in
4. Decentralised models will always be more scalable than centralized ones.
5. Independently verifiable claims are more credible.
6. Learn and leverage existing ecosystems, methodologies, standards and approaches.

### Design Challenges

Implementing end-to-end supply chain traceability at scale faces a number of challenges. 

Challenge | Our approach 
-- | --
A plethora of platforms exist already | We must focus on interoperability between systems, not picking winners. We’ll also provide guidance on how existing systems can extend their capability to support interoperability. 
Technology maturity is variable | We must accommodate small businesses and developing nations and allow a gradual transition from paper processes.
Most traceability pilots have not scaled to production volumes | We must design simple and scalable solutions that can be implemented at scale
Supply chain actors will not expose sensitive data | We must allow stakeholders to protect sensitive commercial information whilst revealing ESG info.
ESG claims have different levels of trust | We must provide sufficient evidence to trust the claims.
Greenwashing fraud is endemic | We need to explicitly identify greenwashing fraud vectors and how to solve them – including product substation, mass balance, etc. In particular, in CRM, suppliers have taken the approach of inserting a middleman and obscuring the traceability to the source. A goal of this approach must be the traceability of claims back to the point of extraction, as required by the OECD due diligence handbook.
Cost | The solution must be cheap enough that there remains a plentiful margin incentive for producers and manufacturers to change behaviour.
