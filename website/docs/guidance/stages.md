This section of the UNTP-CRM project website describes how interested parties can undertake a UNTP-CRM implementation. At this stage of the project, in which UNTP-CRM is still being developed, implementers will be testing draft deliverables and providing feedback to the Project Team. Testing and feedback will enable refinement of deliverables for usability and practicality, and facilitate global scalability, which are principles of the project. 

## Early Implementation

**Familiarize yourself with UNTP-CRM’s core concepts**

We suggest you familiarize yourself with the core concepts listed in the Architecture section, including how they are applied in the CRM context. We also suggest you read the Implementers section of the website to understand the various roles, and consider which role your organization would play as an UNTP-CRM implementer.

**Declare your intent**

State your interest in participation to the project team using this form.  We will follow up with you to assess your suitability for early implementation. 

**Map your community**

As the UNTP-CRM defines a scalable methodology for data sharing among CRM industry actors along supply chains, the value of implementation is only realized through adoption by multiple actors. 

* For supply chain actors, it is beneficial to identify who you buy and sell to, and assess whether they would like to join you as an early implementer, to increase the value of your participation. See the Community Activation section of the UNTP-CRM website for suggested approaches. Also, the UNTP-CRM team can assist with connecting CRM industry actors who have expressed interest in early implementation and could benefit from a collaborative, multi-stakeholder pilot.
* For regulators, performance certifiers, and assurance providers, 
* For software providers

**Identify the sustainability information requested by your buyers and sellers** 

For supply chain actors, such as mining companies, smelters, processors and manufacturers, we suggest you identify the sustainability information that you are being asked for by your buyers and sellers. This will inform the design of the digital product passport you will publish for shipments of your goods. 

As part of the implementation testing phase, the Project Team has created this short survey (15 minutes) which will ask participants to select from a set of ESG criteria, indicating the information they are most often asked to provide to buyers and sellers. The Project Team will follow up with willing respondents for a 30-60 minute information interview. Survey and interview results will assist in the refinement of a finalized sustainability criteria list, which can be used by implementers to design their digital product passports.

**Define your value proposition** 

Based on our interactions with potential early implementers, we’ve observed a typical engagement pattern, in which an interested party within an organization reaches out regarding participation as an implementer, and requires additional information about 1) resources required and 2) value of participation. Armed with this information, they can advocate for participation to other relevant decision makers within their organization, such as their sustainability, IT and supply chain leads. With this in mind, we have developed a value proposition template to assist potential implementers to articulate the benefits of participation, and resources required for their organization.  As  you develop your  value proposition, we suggest you map your community, using the recommendations above, as the value of early implementation will increase when multiple parties can share verified data interoperably. 

We also recommend that you start to develop a second stage implementation plan and business case as you undertake early implementation. Based on our research into funding envelopes with matched funding, they are looking for consortiums that are post-pilot, implementation ready. Consider activating your community/ supply chain as you undertake early implementation to realize full value and prepare for external funding applications.
