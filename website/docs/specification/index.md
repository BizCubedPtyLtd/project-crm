title: Technical Specification
---

The specification is the heart of UNTP-CRM.  It defines the detailed specifications for interoperable implementations. This page provides an outline of the purpose and scope of each component of the specification.

## Architecture

The architecture is the blueprint for all the components of the specification and how they work together. It defines the **design principles** which underpin the UNTP-CRM and shows the components working together from the perspective of a **single actor** and across the **entire value-chain**. The AATP is a fundamentally **decentralised architecture** with no central store of data.
