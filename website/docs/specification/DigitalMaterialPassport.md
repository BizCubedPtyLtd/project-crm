This technical specification is an extension of the UNTP DPP, following the Extensions Methodology. At this stage of the UNTP-CRM project, we are looking to work with implementers to test and refine the material passports below. Built on W3C standards, VCs and Dids, point to UNTP. 

We’re building examples to assist early implementers when deploying and testing.
