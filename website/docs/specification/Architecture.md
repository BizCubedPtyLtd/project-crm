## Overview

The architecture is the blueprint for all the components of the specification and how they work together. It defines the **design principles** which underpin the AATP and shows the components working together from the perspective of a **single actor** and across the **entire value-chain**. The AATP is a fundamentally **decentralised architecture** with no central store of data.

## Principles

1. In alignment with the UNTP extension methodology, UNTP-CRM aligns as closely as possible to UNTP and clearly identifies and explains any adaptations required for use by the CRM industry.
2. Simple and implementable always wins over expansive & complex.
3. Open and free is a fundamental requirement.
4. Collaborative development encourages buy-in.
5. Decentralized models will always be more scalable than centralized ones.
6. Independently verifiable claims are more credible.
7. Learn and leverage existing ecosystems, methodologies, standards and approaches.

# Design Challengesâ€‹

Implementing end-to-end supply chain traceability at scale faces a number of challenges.
