title: Industry Actors
---
Industry actors are buyers, and sellers (or both) along the supply chain. Examples of these actors include (but are not limited to):

* Mining entities
* Processing and beneficiation entities
* Smelters
* Manufacturers
* Importers, distributors, and retailers
* Recycling entities

As an industry actor, your organization will be able to more effectively meet supply chain due diligence obligations for you and your customers. While the commercial interaction between buyers and sellers remains the same, how this is facilitated will be uplifted. As an implementer, you will be able to issue a UN Digital Product Passport with sustainability claims as digital verifiable credentials (VCs) from your existing business systems. You will also issue Traceability Events as VCs with links to upstream products. 

In addition to these functions, you can also receive digital product conformity credentials (DPCCs) from your conformity assessment bodies, as well as publish DPPs, Events, and DPCCs so that they are discoverable from your product identifiers (SKU or batch). You will also be able to discover and verify DPPs linked to your supplies from upstream suppliers. 

As a seller, this means you are better able to meet market access requirements for products exported to increasingly regulated markets, as well as differentiate products based on verifiable sustainability performance. As a buyer, you will be able to receive sustainability data at the right granularity (to aggregate for corporate disclosures) and with the right integrity (to meet governmental requirements on sustainability and circularity).
