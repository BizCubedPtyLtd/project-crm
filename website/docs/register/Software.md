title: Software Providers

Software providers provide the system and software tools that are needed to implement UNTP CRM. These tools hold the data that is needed to issue credentials and also process the data from credentials that are identified, located, and verified. Such tools include enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, sustainability management systems, and traceability platforms.

By implementing UNTP CRM, software providers will be able to empower their customers to participate in global and transparent value chains. For large organizations with existing, heavily customized systems, UNTP CRM implementation may be a customer-specific project. For smaller organizations that use off-the-shelf software, UNTP CRM implementation is more likely to be provided via a feature in a new release. 

Planned UNTP CRM Implementer:

* Northern Block
