## Introduction

Some words about sustainability & resilience and the need for digital traceability and transparency.  Greenwashing challenge & race to the top/ race to the bottom paths ahead

## Document Purpose

To provide the context and guide-rails for the pilot implementations in the CRM domain.

### Audience

## Document Context

TBA

## Project Context

Some words about how this project fit together with and complements other UN work

* UN SDGs, criteria, indicators & tools. They are national level, our project is entity & product level.
* Other UNECE traceability & transparency domains (textile & leather, agro-food).  We build on common foundations.  
* UN/CEFACT trade vocabularies & standards – we use and, where necessary, extend them.
* Industry standards (eg GS1 EPCIS) – we use established and relevant standards wherever they exist (so long as they are open & free) and do not re-invent them.
* Global sustainability standards and regulations – we map them but do not re-invent them.

## Design Principles 

Some words about key design principles.  For example,
* simple and implementable always wins over expansive & complex.
* open and free is a fundamental requirement.
* collaboratively developed encourages buy-in
* decentralised over centralised will always be more scalable.

## Design Challenges

Some words about the key challenges that scalable digital traceability & transparency faces.  The design must solve these challenges.  For example
* greenwashing
* plethora of platforms – so we must focus on in interoperability, not picking winners.
* plethora of standards – so we must focus on mapping between them to maximise reuse.


## Scope 

Some words about the scope of this requirements document.  

* Critical Raw Materials supply chain business modelling (actors, processes, products, etc) for at least 3 minerals.
* Extensions as necessary to traceability standards
* Mappings as necessary for CRM standards & regulations.
* Legal and ethical considerations (mutual recognition, disputes, etc)

 
## The Critical Raw Materials Value Chain
