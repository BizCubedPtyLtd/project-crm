## Introduction
Some words about the plethora of standards & regulations and the need for some shared understanding and mutual recognition, particularly in the cross-border context. 

### Document Purpose

To provide the context and guidelines for the deliverables including sustainability vocabularies and legal/ethical guidelines.

### Audience 

The following stakeholders will be interested in this document

Role | Rationale
--|--
Mining operators | 
Refiners & manufacturers |
ESG standards & certifiers |
Software vendors |
Regulators |

### Document Context

TBA

### Design Principles 

This document is guided by the following principles
1. Simple and implementable always wins over expansive & complex.
2. Open and free is a fundamental requirement.
3. Collaborative development encourages buy-in
4. We can't change existing standards & regulations, only map between them.

### Design Challenges

Implementing end-to-end supply chain transparency at scale faces a number of challenges. 

Challenge | Our approach 
-- | --
A plethora of standards exist already | We must focus on mapping between standards, not picking winners.
Regulations are emerging nearly as fast | We must focus on mutual recognition arrangements so that compliance in an exporting jurisdiction can be re-used by importing jurisdictions.
Complexity is overwhelming | Consumers and buyers can't be expected to understand every criterion of every standard or regulation so we must focus on simple aggregated scoring 
Involuntary non-compliance is likely to be high| We must find simple legal toolkits to support supply chain actors and regulators in managing involuntary non-compliance.
Sustainment Cost | Manually managing between thousands of standards & criteria is likely to be unsustainable so we should look to AI for help.

Some words about relevant ESG standards and regulations as well as emerging initiatives

* Industry standards (IRMA, TSM, etc )
* Transnational initiatives (WEF GBA etc)
* National regulations (EU DPP etc)

### UN Core Vocabulary

Assessment of various standards and mapping to UN core

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Types of Standards

Some words about the governance patterns of various standards (who, why, etc). 

### Types of Audit & Verification

Some words about different types of verification and trust levels are attached to each.

* Self-assessment/peer group 
* On-site instrumentation & measurement
* Third party audit & certification 
* Funding models (who pays for audits)
* Transparency models (audit and/or measurements are public/private)

### Legal interpretation of mappings

Some words about legal considerations of mapping criteria

* Self-assessed mapping and liability
* Third-party assessed mapping (who’s liable if wrong?)
* Formal one-way recognition
* Formal mutual recognition
