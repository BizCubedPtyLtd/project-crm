title: CRM Supply, Demand & ESG Risks

<Disclaimer />

Critical raw materials (CRM) are metals, non-metals (minerals) and other substances (e.g. Helium) that are considered essential for renewable energy transition, digital economy and national security and whose supply may be at risk due to geological scarcity, geopolitical issues, trade policy or other factors. 

CRM classifications might vary between countries, different sections of governments, and different industries (eg. Figure 1. The US DoE Matrix). However, the criticality assignment is always defined by potential supply risk, economic importance (demand), and ESG impact of CRM substances.

The CRM classification from a supply-demand perspective can inform upstream actors (mining operators) to manage risks and realize opportunities. Mining operators will thereby benefit from the ability to extract the value of the certification and regulatory processes they are currently undergoing, and gain competitive advantage by proving their materials have the best sustainability characteristics.
